- SAP integration capabilities
- Compliance and security features

### **Phase 3: Live Demo (20 mins)**
1. **Upload real EABL invoice formats** (with permission)
2. **Show ML extraction** (invoice IDs, amounts, vendors)
3. **Demonstrate SAP lookup** (find matching PO/vendor)
4. **Trigger approval workflow** (email to AP manager)
5. **Show audit trail** and reporting

### **Phase 4: Technical Deep-dive (15 mins)**
- Architecture scalability
- Security controls
- Integration points
- Monitoring and alerting
- DR/backup procedures

### **Phase 5: Business Case (10 mins)**
- ROI analysis specific to EABL
- Implementation roadmap
- Cost structure
- Success metrics

## 📊 **Key Metrics to Demonstrate**

### **Current State (Manual)**
- **Processing time:** 3-5 days per invoice
- **Cost per invoice:** $8-12 USD
- **Error rate:** 5-8%
- **FTE required:** 12-15 people
- **Peak processing delays:** 7-10 days

### **Future State (CashUp Agent)**
- **Processing time:** 5-10 minutes per invoice
- **Cost per invoice:** $0.50-1.00 USD (including infrastructure)
- **Error rate:** <1%
- **FTE required:** 3-4 people (oversight/exceptions)
- **Peak processing:** Same day

### **ROI Calculation**
```
Annual Savings = (Current Cost - Future Cost) × Annual Volume
Annual Savings = ($8 - $0.75) × 180,000 invoices = $1,305,000
Implementation Cost = $150,000
Payback Period = 1.4 months
3-Year ROI = 2,600%
```
